One third of stroke patients suffer from long-term disability and recovery of function is generally inclompete. By combining cutting-edge neurotechniques, such as in vivo MRI, viral tracing and light sheet microscopy, we seek to unravel the cellular and neural circuit mechanisms that underlie motor recovery after experimental stroke. Our studies dissect the development of motor deficits such as spastic muscle tone and develop novel neuromodulation and regeneration paradigms to enhance endogenous plasticity mechanisms and boost stroke recovery.
